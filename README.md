# DiComponents: my personal React component library (WIP)

This is a simple personal react component library built using typescript and storybook. It is inspired by many awesome React component libraries out there.
This is a work in progress. The plan is to build a collection of components that can be used in React projects.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

There is a better way to view all components. We can use storybook. 

### `npm run storybook`

Using storybook is the recommended way to view component details. Launches storybook.
Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/) to view and play storybook in the browser.
You can now play with the component using its controls.
